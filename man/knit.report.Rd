\usage{
knit.report(input.filename, output.filename, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{output.filename}{Markdown or HTML output file.  An HTML file
is specified using the .htm, .html, .HTM or .HTML file extension.
When html is specified, a similarly named markdown file is also
generated.
All output files including cache and figures will appear in the
same folder as \code{output.filename}.}

\item{...}{Arguments to be passed to \code{\link{knitr::knit}}}

\item{rmd.filename}{RMD file.}
}
\description{
Warning: It is quite likely that this will be called within an RMD file
implying a recursive call to knit(). This will generate "duplicate label"
errors for unlabelled chunks. To avoid this, all code chunks
in \code{rmd.filename} should be named.
Supposedly this error can also be avoided by setting the following option:
     options(knitr.duplicate.label='allow')
I tried this but it didn't seem to help.
