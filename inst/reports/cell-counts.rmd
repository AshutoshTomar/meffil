Cell counts were estimated using the `r qc.summary$cell.counts$reference`
cell type methylation profile references.

Boxplot shows the distributions of methylation levels for the CpG
sites used to estimate cell counts
for each sample and reference methylation profile.
Distributions of samples should generally overlap with reference profiles
otherwise estimation will have simply selected the
cell type reference with the nearest mean methylation level.
```{r cell-counts-betas}

Boxplot shows the distributions of estimated cell counts for each
reference cell type across all samples.
```{r cell-counts-estimates}
qc.summary$cell.counts$counts
